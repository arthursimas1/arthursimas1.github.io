## Short Bio

I am currently a full-time MSc student at University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where I am part of the [INTRIG Research Group](https://intrig.dca.fee.unicamp.br/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of S達o Carlos (UFSCar). During my undergraduate studies, I worked on an Undergraduate Research in the field of Artificial Intelligence entitled "_Towards a Power Saving Framework Using Gamification in Cognitive Power Meters_". I also completed my Final Graduation Project in the field of Computing Education entitled "_e-atlas: Tools to Facilitate the Development of School Digital Atlases_" with the help of an Extension Activity Grant to develop my contributions.

Furthermore, I served as a tutor for three different classes, including Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Programming, and Organization and Retrieval of Information. After graduating, I gained experience as a Software Engineer in the area of data analysis and business intelligence.

As a current Master's student, I am advising some undergraduate students, which rendered in an accepted demo paper co-authored with my undergraduate students. I have gained experience in work, tutoring, and research experience in collaboration with Ericsson-funded projects, including to the research project "_5G Services in Programmable Networks with Machine Learning_", contributing to the development of a framework to capture 5G traces and YouTube QoE metrics, and also in a live 5G operational dataset collection campaigns in S達o Paulo and Campinas.

## Research interests
