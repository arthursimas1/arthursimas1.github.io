## Abstract
Spatial-temporal data represents the occupation of objects in space at a given moment in time. An interface for visualizing this type of data is essential in movement patterns analysis and object monitoring. However, despite the great interest in research on this type of data, there are few tools for visualizing object trajectories. In this sense, this project proposes PathsViewer, a tool for visualizing spatial-temporal data. To evaluate the proposed tool, datasets from different sources were used, such as georeferenced 5G traces, and vehicle trajectories.

## Context
This work originated as the Final Undergraduate Project of an undergraduate student. I am currently involved in advising the ongoing development of this tool. Together with some undergraduate students, we are continuously enhancing and refining PathsViewer to ensure its effectiveness and usability in the field of spatial-temporal data analysis.
